Some tools to archive teletext from MPEG transport streams and process it further


extract_from_ts:
ts_to_packets.sh takes 2 parameters, the first is the Transport stream, the second is the file the packets will be stored in.
dump_text.c dumps the text from a file with the packets. This is usefull for quick checks.
